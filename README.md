# Programming vs Anime

Ever personified your programming languages? See how they compare with popular character in anime like Naruto, Bleach, One Piece and many more.

## How it works

Every programming language has its quirks. These quirks are characteristics of the language that define it. They are the programming language's personality.

We find out the popular characteristics of a programming language, see which Anime character it seems most like and make the match. The similar characteristics have to be pointed out.

## What is Anime?

Really? If you have to ask this, I strongly suggest visiting [NarutoBase](http://narutobase.net) or [MangaPanda](http://mangapanda.com).

## Is this limited to Japanese Manga and Anime?

We hope not. There are well developed characters in various Animation and Comic Universes. If you find a comic or animation universe you would like to add, feel free.

## Anime List

- [Naruto](naruto.md)

## Language List

Check out the languages we match to anime characters [here](languages.md).

## Match Rules

- Before you match a programming language to an anime character, there must be at least one matching characteristic of both the anime-character and the programming-language.

- If at any time, a character in the same anime is shown to have more matching characteristics with a programming-language than its current matching anime-character, that character becomes the new match for that programming-language
